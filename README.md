# Collaborative User-Interfaces with Functional Reactive Programming

Work by Kristoffer Just Andersen at Aarhus University

October, 2013

The code in this repository was produced in the process of
investigating the aptitude of the [Elm Programming
Language](http://elm-lang.org/), a recent, up-and-comming functional
programming language of the FRP flavour, for programming collaborative
user interfaces, such as we know them from Google Docs.

The main product is found in the file `Canvas2.elm`, in which we
present a collaborative vector drawing app with multiple tools, with
transparency of distribution.

We refer to the accompanying report found [here](http://kja.compsci.dk/files/elm-report.pdf) for more details.
